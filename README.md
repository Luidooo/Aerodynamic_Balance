# Aerodynamic Balance Documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for the Aerodynamic Balance project! This project was developed by students of the University of Brasilia to create a balance capable of measuring aerodynamic forces on objects. In this documentation, you'll find information on the project, how to use the balance, contribute to the project, and more.

## Project Overview
The Aerodynamic Balance is a device designed to measure aerodynamic forces acting on objects placed within its testing area. It provides accurate data on lift, drag, and other aerodynamic parameters, making it useful for a variety of applications including aerospace engineering, wind tunnel testing, and vehicle design.

## Features
- **Measurement Capabilities:** The balance can accurately measure aerodynamic forces such as lift and drag.
- **Data Logging:** It allows for data logging to record and analyze aerodynamic measurements over time.
- **User Interface:** The balance features a user-friendly interface for easy operation and data visualization.

## How to Use
To use the Aerodynamic Balance, follow these steps:
1. Set up the balance in a suitable testing environment, ensuring it is securely mounted.
2. Connect the necessary sensors and instrumentation according to the provided instructions.
3. Power on the balance and calibrate it as needed.
4. Place the object to be tested within the balance's testing area.
5. Initiate data collection and record the aerodynamic forces acting on the object.
6. Analyze the collected data using the provided tools or export it for further analysis.
